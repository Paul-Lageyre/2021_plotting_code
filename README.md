# 2021_plotting_code
Code used to plot the results presented in papers written by Paul LAGEYRE et al. in 2021.

The repository is comprised of folders separating the different codes.

For each of these folders we have:
VisuHeavi files determine the solution.
TestFiguresHeavi files put in place a number of plotting functions which are used, as well as the constants used.
FiguresCyl files show the parameters used by the author and can directly be run to generate and save figures.

Updates:
23/03/2022 - Added the code pieces for the oscillating case, and the case associated with an linearly polarized electromagnetic pulse.
             The precedently existing Mobile Cylinder codes are now under the Circularly Polarized Source folder.

09/08/2021 - Multiplied by 2 some functions to take into account the actual constant in front of the stress-energy tensor in linearized Einstein's equations.

29/04/2021 - Added the plotting programs for the generation of a gravitational deformation by a cylinder of constant energy density, both in a static case and a case moving at the speed of light.
