# 2021_plotting_code
Code used to plot the results presented in papers written by Paul LAGEYRE et al. in 2021.

The repository is comprised of folders separating the different codes.

Updates:
29/04/2021 - Added the plotting programs for the generation of a gravitational deformation by a cylinder of constant energy density, both in a static case and a case moving at the speed of light.

VisuHeavi files determine the solution
TestFiguresHeavi files put in place a number of plottting function which are used, as well as the constants used
FiguresCyl files show the parameters used by the author and can directly be run to generate and save figures.
